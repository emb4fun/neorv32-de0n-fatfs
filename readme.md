#### README for neorv32-de0n-fatfs
This project is a port of an <a href="https://www.emb4fun.de/fpga/fatfs/index.html" target="new">older</a>
FPGA project of mine where a different CPU was used. Since the DE0-Nano board does not have an SD card
holder, an external card holder was connected to the board with jumper wire.
